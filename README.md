### Hey, hey. ðŸ‘‹

My name is EstevÃ£o Prado. I'm a PhD student in Statistics in the Hamilton Institute, Maynooth University, Ireland. I work on extension to Bayesian Additive Regression trees under the supervision of Professor Andrew Parnell and co-supervision of Dr. Rafael Moral.

I got my bachelor's degree in Statistics at Federal University of Paran\'a (2010/2013) and a Research MSc in Statistics (2014/16) at Federal University of Minas Gerais. During the masters, I worked with implementation and comparison of different adaptive and non-adaptive MCMC methods to a specific setting of GLMM (see the text here (in portuguese)).

My main research interests lie in computational statistics and statistical modeling through GLMMs, estimation equations, and bayesian and likelihood-based methods. Besides the theoretical background, I love to analyze data and make pretty and useful visualizations.
