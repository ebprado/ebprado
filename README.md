### Hey, hey. ðŸ‘‹

I'm EstevÃ£o Prado and I'm a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Hamilton Institute, Maynooth University, Ireland. Since 2018, I have been working on extensions to Bayesian Additive Regression trees (BART) under the supervision of professors Andrew Parnell and Rafael Moral.

I got my BSc in Statistics from UFPR (2010-13) and an MSc in Statistics (2014-16) from UFMG. During the masters, I worked with implementation and comparison of different adaptive and non-adaptive MCMC methods to a specific setting of a GLMM; see the text [here](https://repositorio.ufmg.br/bitstream/1843/BUBD-A9ZGXY/1/principal.pdf) (in portuguese).

My main research interests lie in tree-based methods, Bayesian non-parametric regression, and computational statistics. Besides research, I worked at HSBC (2013) and HSBC/Bradesco (2016-18) banks with credit modelling.
