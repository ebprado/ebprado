### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is EstevÃ£o Prado and I'm a senior research associate in statistical machine learning in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Lancaster University under a fellowship partnered with The Alan Turing Institute. I work with Professors [Christopher Nemeth](https://chris-nemeth.github.io/) and [Chris Sherlock]([https://chris-nemeth.github.io/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X-5SzgsAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao)) on the development of novel scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for large datasets.

I completed my [PhD](https://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/17285/1/Thesis_Estevao_Batista.pdf) in Statistics at Maynooth University (Ireland) under the supervision of Professor Andrew Parnell and Dr. Rafael Moral where I worked on extensions to probabilistic tree-based machine learning algorithms. I hold an [MRes](https://repositorio.ufmg.br/bitstream/1843/BUBD-A9ZGXY/1/principal.pdf) in Statistics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (Brazil) and a first-class honours Bsc in Statistics from the Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (Brazil).

My main research interests lie in tree-based methods, Bayesian non-parametric regression, MCMC and computational statistics. Besides academia, I worked as a data scientist for 3.5 years at Bradesco and HSBC banks with statistical modelling for credit purposes. My programming background involves advanced knowledge of R (+10 yr), SAS (+5 yr), SQL (+5 yr) and, more recently, an intermediate level of Python.
