### Hey, hey. ðŸ‘‹

My name is EstevÃ£o Prado and I'm a PhD student in Statistics in the Hamilton Institute, Maynooth University, Ireland. I work on extension to Bayesian Additive Regression trees under the supervision of Professor Andrew Parnell and co-supervision of Dr. Rafael Moral.

I got my bachelor's degree in Statistics at Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (2010/13) and a Research MSc in Statistics (2014/16) at Federal University of Minas Gerais. During the masters, I worked with implementation and comparison of different adaptive and non-adaptive MCMC methods to a specific setting of a GLMM; see the text [here](https://repositorio.ufmg.br/bitstream/1843/BUBD-A9ZGXY/1/principal.pdf) (in portuguese).

I worked at HSBC (2013) and HSBC/Bradesco banks in Brazil in the Departament of Credit Modelling.

<!--
My main research interests lie in computational statistics and statistical modeling through GLMMs, estimation equations, and bayesian and likelihood-based methods. Besides the theoretical background, I love to analyze data and make pretty and useful visualizations.
