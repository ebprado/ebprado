### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is EstevÃ£o Prado and I'm a senior Data Scientist in the Department of Data Intelligence at Bradesco bank, Brazil. I develop credit risk models which automate/scale credit decisions and mitigate risk using statistics and machine learning. My programming background involves advanced knowledge of R (e.g., dplyr, ggplot), SAS, SQL and Python (e.g., PySpark, pandas).

Prior to my current position, I was a senior research associate (i.e., a post-doctoral) in statistical machine learning at Lancaster University, UK, under a fellowship partnered with The Alan Turing Institute. I worked with Professors [Christopher Nemeth](https://chris-nemeth.github.io/) and [Chris Sherlock](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X-5SzgsAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR&oi=ao) on the development of novel scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for large datasets.

I completed my [PhD](https://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/17285/1/Thesis_Estevao_Batista.pdf) in Statistics at Maynooth University, Ireland, under the supervision of Professor [Andrew Parnell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZlmTSR4AAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Rafael Moral](https://rafamoral.github.io/index.html) where I worked on extensions to probabilistic tree-based machine learning algorithms. I hold an [MRes](https://repositorio.ufmg.br/bitstream/1843/BUBD-A9ZGXY/1/principal.pdf) in Statistics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (Brazil) and a first-class honours Bsc in Statistics from the Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (Brazil).
